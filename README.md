# CIFAR10_Logistic_Regression
Multinomial Logistic Regression model trained with mini-batch SGD on the CIFAR-10 image dataset.
26% accuracy achieved on the test set after 100 training epochs. 
Images were converted to grayscale to reduce computational load, hence better accuracy could be achieved using all the RGB channels.
